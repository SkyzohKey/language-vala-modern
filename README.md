# Vala language support in Atom

Add syntax highlighting and snippets to Vala files in Atom.

Forked from the [`language-vala`](https://github.com/evfool/language-vala)
package, the main difference is that this package is more actively maintained.
If you use the `language-vala` package you will find that it does **not**
automatically syntax-highlight Vala files. This package does, as it includes the
`scopeName` field in its `grammars/vala.cson` file.
